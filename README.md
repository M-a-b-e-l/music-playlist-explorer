### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in Lab number two specifically helped me get comfortable writing functions in JavaScript such at the arrow function which I was previously not familiar in. Additionally, this unit's labs helped me reinforce my knowledge of event listeners and how they work to make our pages mpre interactive. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have continue working on the layout of the website as well as its responsiveness. Spotify was my main inspiration for the theme of this website, thus I would have also liked to include a search bar that filters the playlists by name and creator. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

In my project demo I really a nice job in describing my features, setbacks, and how I went about approaching them. During this time, I saw some of my peers implement the add/delete playlist feature which was really cool to see in action. Additionally, some of my peers added icons which made their websites look more authentic.
